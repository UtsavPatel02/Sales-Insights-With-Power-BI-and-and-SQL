Hi There!
Welcome to the Sales Insights Project! This project explores sales insights data through the help of Power BI and SQL.



Project Overview
In this project, I employed SQL for data cleaning and manipulation to optimally prepare the data for analysis. Post-data preparation, the clean dataset was utilized in Power BI to create a user-friendly and interactive dashboard that visually represents the sales insights.



About The Files
The repository holds a folder containing various files that document the different stages of this project:
PDF Sample: For those who prefer not to download the full Power BI file, a PDF document is available that provides a glimpse into what the dashboard looks like. This can be a quick way to see the end results without the need for Power BI :)



Feel free to explore the files and reach out if you have any questions or feedback!
